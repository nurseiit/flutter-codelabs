# Flutter Example apps

These are the apps from various tutorials and guides I found online. Some contain their own README.

## Running the app locally :smirk:

You can follow these instructions to build the apps
and install them onto your device.

* _Note that some of the apps require different **flutter** channels to run properly (see in the corresponding README files)._

## Prerequisites

If you are new to Flutter, please first follow
the [Flutter Setup](https://flutter.io/setup/) guide.

### Install tools

1. You should have _flutter SDK_ installed on your machine.
    * Do so via visiting the [Flutter's official website](https://flutter.io).

2. Install either _ios_ or _android_ development toolchain.
    * Follow the instructions of the `flutter doctor` command.

3. Install **Flutter's** helper extensions for your favorite IDE / editor.

### Run the app

1. Install app's (*flutter*) packages via `flutter packages get`.

2. Run the app either by using the extension in your IDE or by running `flutter run` inside the application directory.
